# Getting Started

Signal Web UI is a layered system: **@signal-web-ui/core** ships standards-based custom elements, while framework wrappers provide idiomatic bindings for React, Vue, Angular, and Ember. You can mix and match based on how your app is structured.

## What ships in the system

- **Core web components**: the canonical implementations, distributed as custom elements.
- **Framework wrappers**: lightweight bindings that align with your framework conventions.
- **Theme tokens**: CSS variables and theme data attributes for runtime theming.

## Recommended first steps

1. Install the core package alongside the framework wrapper you need.
2. Initialize the loader (if you are bundling custom elements).
3. Set a default theme and validate it in the playground.

## Where to go next

- Visit the **Installation** section for package commands and workspace notes.
- Read **CDN usage** for script tag examples and module/nomodule builds.
- Explore **Theming** to see how design tokens map to CSS variables.
